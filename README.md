## Evaluating the highest achievable precision in multiparameter estimation strategies

This repository serves as a companion to the research paper Zhao-Yi Zhou and Da-Jian Zhang, "Evaluating the highest achievable precision in multiparameter estimation strategies". 

### Structure of the repository

The code in this repository is used to assist the study of the three-dimensional magnetic field estimation problem. The code used to study the noiseless case is stored in `Noiseless`, while the code for the noisy case is stored in `Noise`.

### Basic requirement 

- The `CVX` package should be installed. See [this website](http://cvxr.com/cvx/doc/install.html) for guidance. We use [MOSEK](https://www.mosek.com/) as the optimization solver.
- The `QETLAB` toolbox is required. The toolbox can be downloaded by following [this documentation](https://qetlab.com/Installation).
